## Still to do

* use a Service Worker
* that responds with a 200 when offline
* manifest should contains background_color, theme_color & icons at least 192px
* add meta name theme-color tag
* try to re-use img tag (actually 3 img with v-bind:src)
* create vue components if needed
* handle case when MediaNext (for example) is pressed on the web client but will also trigger system
* handle case when server shut down, avoid letting client playing or loading
* improve mobile experience
* handle last music action, like a dropdown that will act on n-1 song : was good, was bad
* add options modal to let user choose : audio output [client|none|server], playing songs from [good|test] folder
* add a gif demo usage
* add desktop notifications like http://singhharkirat.com/notification-logger/
